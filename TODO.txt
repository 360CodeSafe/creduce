TODO list:

remove array dimension from a variable

do copy propagation
  especially try to replace calls and arguments with available exprs

replace for-loops with expressions guessed from initializers
  guess that it executes 0 and 1 times 

simplify if/foo statements 
from:
  if (stuff1) { stuff2 }
to
  stuff1
  stuff2 

replace a function call foo(x, y) with
  * value with correct type
    - for integer, make it as 0
    - for pointer, make it as NULL
    - for struct, add a new global tmp var

  * a comma expr, (x, y, rv)
    where rv is a value with the correct type

simplify a comma expression below:
from
  x = (y, z);
to 
  y;
  x = z;

- turn a union into a struct

- (low priority) format string reductions:

 * remove anything that's not a %d or whatever from the format string

 * remove a %d directive and also the corresponding argument from a printf
