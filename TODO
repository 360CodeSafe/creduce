c_reduce TODO list:

pass explicit state objects to passes
add an option to keep stats about fast vs. slow tests
expose quiet on command line
add an option limiting the number of passes
see if some passes want to work back to front
watch for unexpected abnormal compiler outputs
exploit early-exit from delta test to speed this up
  keep per-pass statistic on the probability of requiring the slow test
  invert this to decide how many fast tests to run in a row
  need to keep checkpoints

--------------------------------------------------------------------

clang_delta TODO list:

replace for-loops with expressions guessed from initializers
  guess that it executes 0 and 1 times 

reduce the indirect level of struct member accesses
  s.f1.f2.f3 => s.f1.f2 or s.f2.f3
  Note that to do these kinds of simplification, we also need to 
  change struct declarations appropriately.

change string literals

change operators to other operators, e.g., replace / with +

rename enumerate types

- add supports to C++ specific features
 * simplify class names
 
 * remove namespace

 * simplify template stuff

- (low priority) format string reductions:

 * remove anything that's not a %d or whatever from the format string

 * remove a %d directive and also the corresponding argument from a printf
