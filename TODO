c_reduce TODO list:

make a distribution using Philip Guo's packager
  need to include Perl?

add some regression tests

integrate changes from PLDI work

change SUCCESS to OK

pass explicit state objects to passes

add an option to keep stats about fast vs. slow tests

see if speedup is gotten by running line-delta from back to front

watch for unexpected abnormal compiler outputs

exploit early-exit from delta test to speed this up
  keep per-pass statistic on the probability of requiring the slow test
  invert this to decide how many fast tests to run in a row
  need to keep checkpoints of reducer state + file

factor timeout out of test script: c_reduce can supply a timeout
  decrease it as the test starts to run faster

--------------------------------------------------------------------

clang_delta TODO list:

replace for-loops with expressions guessed from initializers
  guess that it executes 0 and 1 times 

reduce the indirect level of struct member accesses
  s.f1.f2.f3 => s.f1.f2 or s.f2.f3
  Note that to do these kinds of simplification, we also need to 
  change struct declarations appropriately.

change string literals

change operators to other operators, e.g., replace / with +

rename enumerate types

- add supports to C++ specific features
 * simplify class names
 
 * remove namespace

 * simplify template stuff

 * rename class member functions to m_fn1 ...

 * rename class member variables to m_a, m_b ...

 * seems simple-inliner doesn't work with class member functions,
   need to fix it or add a CXX-specific inlining pass

 * reduce the level of class inheritance

- (low priority) format string reductions:

 * remove anything that's not a %d or whatever from the format string

 * remove a %d directive and also the corresponding argument from a printf
