C-Reduce 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Reduce is a generic delta debugger.

It is somewhat similar to this delta tool:

  http://delta.tigris.org/

But it does a better job when used to reduce C code.

At its core, C-Reduce is a simple fixpoint computation; all of the
transformations are done by plugins. In princpiple, C-Reduce can be
tailored to reduce any failure-inducing input, but so far it has only
reduced C and C++ programs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

see the file INSTALL

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

THIS_PATH/c_reduce/c_reduce.pl ./test.sh file.c

file.c is a C program that causes a compiler to do something
bad

test.sh is a shell script that takes no arguments -- it should be
hard-coded to refer to the same C file that is passed as an argument
to C-Reduce.  It should return 0 for an interesting delta variant
and return any other value for an uninteresting variant.

HINTS:

- it is often useful for the test script to invoke external tools
  under time and memory limits

- the test script should run cheap parts of its test first

- the test script can filter out some kinds of undesirable variants by
  inspecting compiler warnings

- see test*.sh in the "scripts" directory for examples

Feedback:

The authors of C-Reduce would love to hear failure or success stories.
